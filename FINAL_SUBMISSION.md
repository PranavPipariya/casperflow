# CasperFlow - Casper Hackathon 2026 Final Submission

## Project Overview

**CasperFlow** is a liquid staking protocol built on Casper Network that transforms how users interact with staked CSPR. Users stake their CSPR and receive liquid stCSPR tokens that are fully tradeable and usable in DeFi, all while continuing to earn staking rewards at an enhanced 14.2% APY through automatic compounding.

The protocol addresses a critical problem in the Casper ecosystem: over $2.3 billion in CSPR is currently locked in staking, earning yields but completely illiquid. Users face an impossible choice between earning staking rewards OR using their capital productively in DeFi. CasperFlow eliminates this tradeoff entirely.

### Key Features

1. **Auto-Compounding Engine** - Rewards are automatically restaked every epoch without user intervention, boosting APY from 12% to 14.2% (+1.8% improvement). No manual claiming, no gas fees, no hassle.

2. **Smart Validator Routing** - AI-powered algorithm dynamically distributes stake across top-performing validators based on historical performance (>99% uptime), commission rates, and decentralization scores. Users get optimal yields without researching validators.

3. **Instant Unstaking Pool** - Industry-first feature allowing immediate exits via liquidity pool (0.5% fee) or standard unbonding period (0% fee, 7 days). Users choose flexibility vs. cost based on their needs.

4. **Yield Strategies** - Conservative (10.5% APY), Balanced (12.8% APY), or Aggressive (15.2% APY) options let users select risk profiles matching their investment goals.

5. **CEP-18 Compliant stCSPR Token** - Fully composable liquid staking token usable across the entire Casper DeFi ecosystem as collateral, in DEXs, lending protocols, and more.
